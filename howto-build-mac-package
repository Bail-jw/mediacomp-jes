** how to build a .app package for JES!
Alex Rudnick (alexr@cc.gatech.edu), November 2006, Jan 2007

- open up Jar Bundler (in /Developer/Applications/Java Tools)

- copy the jes directory out of subversion
  cp -r mediacomp-dev/jes jes-snapshot

- To make the distribution smaller, delete all of the .svn directories that
  you may have copied over, like this:

cd jes-snapshot
find . -name '.svn' -exec rm -rf {} \;

- add all of the jars in the jars/ directory, under "classpath and files".

- now add all of the .py, .java, and .class files from "Sources". It's okay
  to do a "select all" -- we don't need the things in the subdirectories of
  Sources. Also, add everything from the jython-2.1/Lib directory, not
  including subdirectories.

- now under "Build Information", use the main class "JESstartup" (if you
  like, choose the JESstartup.class file from the jes-snapshot directory
  you created)

- Under "Options", turn on "Use Macintosh Menu Bar", "Anti-alias text",
  "Anti-alias graphics". Put "1.5*" in the JVM Version box, which means
  that we will use Java 1.5.

- On the last tab, "Properties", put the VM options "-Xmx512m". Make sure
  to also click "set working directory to inside application package" and
  "allow mixed localizations". The defaults are alright for everything
  else.

- Back on that first tab, use JESi2.icns as the custom icon. Create the
  application with the "Create Application" button.

- Now, go into the JES.app/Contents/Resources/Java directory, and say:

cp -r ~/mediacomp-dev/jes/JESHelp .
cp ~/mediacomp-dev/jes/JESAPIHelp.html .
cp ~/mediacomp-dev/jes/JES*txt .
cp -r ~/mediacomp-dev/jes/images .
find . -name '.svn' -exec rm -rf {} \;

Congratulations, you should be ready to go! (this should come out to be
about 8.2 megabytes total.)

Post the thing to coweb.cc.gatech.edu/mediaComp-teach/26.
The password for that is "barb", like on the other locked pages.
And the "password to access the page" is attach:carmen, just like on other
pages on the coweb.
