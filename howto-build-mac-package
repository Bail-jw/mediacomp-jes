To build a Mac distribution:

Open up Jar Bundler (in /Developer/Applications/Java Tools)
Under "Classpath and Files" add:
 -All of the jars in the jars/ directory
 -Select all from the Sources folder to get all of the .py, .java, and .class files. Jar Bundler will yell at you for trying to add subfolders. This is okay, we don't need them.
 -Select all from the Jython-2.2.1/Lib folder (adjust for whatever version of Jython you're using). Same as before, Jar Bundler will yell at you, and it's still okay.
Under "Build Information", use the main class JESstartup
Under "Options", turn on "Use Macintosh Menu Bar", "Anti-alias text", "Anti-alias graphics". Put "1.5+" in the JVM version box, which means we'll use Java 1.5.
On the last tab, "Properties", put the VM options "-Xmx512m". Make sure to also click "Set working directory to inside application package" and "allow mixed localizations". Set the version number appropriately. The defaults are okay for everything else.
Back on the first tab, use JESi2.icns as the custom icon (located in the images folder). 
Create the application with the "Create Application" button.

In the terminal, go to the JES.app/Contents/Resources/Java directory and do (assuming your source code is in ~/mediacomp-dev/jes):
cp -r ~/mediacomp-dev/jes/JESHelp .
cp ~/mediacomp-dev/jes/JES*.html .
cp ~/mediacomp-dev/jes/JES*.txt .
cp -r ~/mediacomp-dev/jes/images .

This should come out to ~12 MB. (Remember to take out things you don't need from the Windows version, like the win-jre folder or the .exe file.)
