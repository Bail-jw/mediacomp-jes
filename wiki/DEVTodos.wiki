Completed items
    * Why does pickAFile() hang?  --- Believed to be non thread safe operations with GUI components being created/edited in the interpreter thread.  Dorn fixed 5/8/09 by refactoring code in media.py and FileChooser.java.
    * Fix input() and raw_input() to work from Console Dorn fixed 5/14/09 with edits to media.py, JESCommandWindow.py, JESInputManager.py, SimpleInput.java, and SimpleOutput.java.
    * Config writer for java: redesigning configuration writing from python to java -- buck working on it -- need to update all the evil code where we use this and make config writing work (and be done consistently and on exit)
    * about dialogs and splash screen need to be updated to reflect similar version numbers -- 4.2beta is what we sent to Monica for summer 2009
