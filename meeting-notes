Make sure to post the most recent version of the TODO on the coweb. Keep on
tranglin'.

Things that are important:
- clean up or recreate the bug list.
  -- maybe we can put a captcha on Trac?
  -- alternatively: we need a way to get bugs from people who find them to
  us.

- missing/wrong documentation: for one thing, AddLine is not in the
  documentation. Make sure that all the visible functions have
  documentations. In the docs it needs to be clear which functions
  (setBlue, etc) are clamped.

- Barb's code that's currently in JES has some issues with it...
  fix that, based on BookClasses.

- There's a movie tool: FrameSequence. That would be lovely to add into
  JES.

- Test to see if Alyce's speedups are real speedups. Look into what it
  would take to do the CPython version. Look into Dr. Python? Alternatively
  Jython 2.2?

- The reason why we distribute a JRE with JES: think about the cs1315
  students.

- Think about finding some galleries from other institutions?
