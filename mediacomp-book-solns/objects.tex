Remember the \newterm{modules} that we saw?  Those are akin to \newterm{objects}.  We'll use \newterm{dot notation}.

\code{sound.writeTo} and \code{picture.writeTo} are easier than remembering \code{writeSoundTo} and \code{writePictureTo}.  It's always \code{writeTo}.

Both colors and pixels understand \code{getRed}.  Makes it easier to work with.
