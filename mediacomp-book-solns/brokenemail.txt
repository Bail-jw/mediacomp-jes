We spent most of the Nov. 12 meeting tidying up issues on the MATLAB certification course CS1771.
- Jo McIver says that we can't automatically prevent students from enrolling in both CS1771 and CS1371, so we need to figure out a scheme to block students from registering for both, if we find that to be an issue.
- Jo's biggest concern is that students get access to the MATLAB materials well before they reach campus.  Ray plans to alert the RETP advisors and have them take charge of the problem.
- We also have to make sure that we somehow process CS1771 credit quickly--if students pass the first test, we have to somehow record a final grade for them immediately and clear them to take their next classes.

We also went through Ray's and now JimC's diagrams to talk about how the sequence of classes and transfers is to be described and communicated to others.  It sounds like some combination of Ray, JimC, and coordinators will create diagrams for each individual Engineering unit.

There was also discussion of the unused capacity in CS1371 and how CS1321 is overfull.  Ray said that he'd get the coordinators to contact their students and get them moved from 1321 to 1371.

I think we're at the point that we can take transfer off the table for now.  I'll try to get the CS1771 course proposal form together, so that we can start the process of getting it created with the CoC Undergrad Committee (which Rich chairs).

There was a brief discussion of the TAing course.  It will be for letter grade, with real evaluation and outline.  We hope to convince the Engineering units (and others) to allow students to use this course for a CS elective.

The topic for our Nov. 26 meeting (for all two of us who can make it the day before Thanksgiving) is "What's next?"  We have redesigned how 1371 and 1315 are going to be offered, and we've come up with a solution for Engineering transfer students.

From our original charge, we have one more priority from the College of Computing to discuss: How can we get wider CS faculty input on these courses to make sure that the content is fresh and exciting, and get faculty mindshare?  Currently we use a "course owner/administrator" model, but we don't have one yet for CS1317.  Stick with this model?
  I'm hoping that Merrick will have more input for us on what he wants here.

What's next?  Some of the other topics that we have considered include:
- Definition of CS1322 -- what do we want to come after 1371 and 1315/1316?
- Assessment -- how do we want to keep tabs on our courses?
- Discuss and define CS1316, second course after CS1315.
- Define a minor or specialization in Computing.
- Decide when to bring in representatives from other Colleges into the Steering Committee.

We'll be talking about what's next for this committee at the meeting on the 26th.
