Ticket #45 
pickAFile in JES on OS-X
Priority:	normal	Reporter:	mgonchor@email.smith.edu	
Severity:	normal	Assigned to:	guzdial	
Component:	JES - Distributions	Status:	new	
Version:	1.0	Resolution:	 	
Milestone:	Create JES Testing Infrastructure	Keywords:	 	
Description by mgonchor@email.smith.edu:

In OS-X, the wheel (equivalent of the mouse turning into an hourglass)
turns endlessly and sometimes will cause OS-X to stop responding
entirely if I 1) Use pickAFile() to pick a sound file 2) Then load and
run test() 3) Then try pickAFile() again and the wheel turns
continuously

in this case, test() is a simple program: def test(): 

x = 5 print x 

There are no error messages as I gave up waiting after 2 hours.

There are no hidden dialog boxes behind JES, or any other program that
is open.




From Robert Sloan (UIC) 6 March 2005

On Mac OS 10.3, JES windows viloate Mac UI guidelines by not SHOWING
texture in lower right corner to indicate that window is
resizable. (Other random freeware written in Java gets this right on
the Mac, it's probably not too hard to fix.)
